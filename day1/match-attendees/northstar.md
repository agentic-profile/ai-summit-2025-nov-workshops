# Matchwise - Venture Summary

For people who network at business and social events that want to save time by quickly finding the best leads, Matchwise is a business and social networking app that curates the next best people to network with. Unlike LinkedIn, our product uses deep research, geolocation, and selective disclosure to uncover the best leads.

## Problem

- Before an event, it's hard to research the people that will be there
- Good matching requires more data than services like LinkedIn have
- At events, it's easy to get stuck in dead-end conversations
- At events, there's not enough time to talk to everyone to find the best match
- Even if we find that "best" person, we might not ask the right questions to surface the best synergies

## Market Opportunity

- **IRL business networking events**: $1,000,000,000,000
- **Dating**: $10,000,000,000

## Solution

- Secure environment for people to selectively disclose more information
- Multiple markets/matching services 
- Deep research
- "Last mile" peer-to-peer AI conversational matching
